# Defibrillator Monitor
The purpose of this project was to control the temperature inside a defibrillator box, since portable defibrillators are powered with lithium-ion-batteries which are temperature dependent. The intention of the project was to control two heat-plates with a microcontroller, powered from a 12V battery. The microcontroller should also be able to monitor the voltage level of the battery, and with Wi-Fi create an IoT-solution so the user gets detailed information in the phone.
